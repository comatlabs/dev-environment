# dev-environment

This repo defines an Ubuntu 18.04 LTS (Bionic) VM development environment.
Canonical's Multipass will bring up the VM and configure it with cloud-init.
There are a couple steps outside Multipass to support hyper-v enhanced session mode.
It should work fine with Multipass on other non-Windows platforms.
